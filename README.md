# Stroke-Prediction-Analysis

Took a public healthcare dataset from Kaggle and created two models using different methods to predict if an individual is likely to have a stroke or not.
The two methods were Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
Random Forest gave an overall higher accuracy than Logistic.

But one of the main con of a dataset like this is that they are highly imbalanced. Stroke is something that can occur due to an infinite number of varibles and we have a very little control over the variables we can keep track of. In this model, I took majority of the pivotal variables but there are always going to be some variables left. So all of this accounts for the inaccuracy the two model depicts.
